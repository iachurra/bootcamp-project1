				<h3>My Journey to Software Engineering</h3>
				<p>As an field taught real estate professional, most of my experience was gathered through mentors and a wide array of real estate projects. While working in startups, I proved my ability in operations to use my skill sets in corporate. After starting in operations support, I grew within a company to lead the lab facility programs but due to the reduction of real estate porfolio my position ended. Found another role but the same thing happened. As someone in operations, there is usually one manager and several project managers but I did not have the resume to work on the field making me less desireable. I needed a skill set that not only complimented my operations skills but gave me a skill to create and build things. So here I am, taking my first step into Software Engineering. </p>
